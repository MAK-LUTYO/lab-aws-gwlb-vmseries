## 1.1. Overview

This lab will involve deploying a solution for AWS using Palo Alto Networks VM-Series in the Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) topology.

The lab assumes an existing Panorama that the VM-Series will bootstrap to. Panorama assumptions:
- Accessible with public IP on TCP 3978
- Prepped with Template Stacks and Device Groups
- vm-auth-key generated on Panorama

This guide is intended to be used with a specific QwikLabs scenario, and some steps are specific to Qwiklabs. This could be easily adapted for other environments.

## 1.2. Lab Guide Syntax conventions

- Items with a bullet indicate actions that need to be taken to complete the lab. They are sometimes followed with a code block for copy / paste or reference.
```
Example Code block following an action item
```

> &#8505;  Items with info icon are additional context or details around actions performed in the lab

> &#10067; Items with question mark icon are quesions that should be answered on the form

# 3. Lab Steps
## 3.1. Initialize Lab

- Download `Lab Details` File from Qwiklabs interface for later reference
- Click Open Console and authenticate to AWS account with credentials displayed in Qwiklabbs
- Verify in correct region 

### 3.1.1. Find SSH Key Pair Name

- EC2 Console -> Key pairs
- Copy and record the name of the Key Pair that was generated by Qwiklabs, e.g. `qwikLABS-L17939-10286`
- In Qwiklabs console, download the ssh key for later use (PEM and PPK options available)

> &#8505; Any EC2 Instance must be associated with a SSH keypair, which is the default method of initial interactive login to EC2 instances. With successful bootstrapping, there should not be any need to connect to the VM-Series instances direclty with this key, but it is usually good to keep this key securely stored for any emergency backdoor access. For this lab, we will use the keypair automatically generated by Qwiklabs. The key will also be used for connecting to the test web server instances.


TODO: Use SSM for linux instances, then no need to handle keys

## 3.2. Update IAM Policies


- Search for `IAM` in top searchbar (IAM is global)
- In IAM dashboard select Users -> awsstudent
- Expand `default_policy`, Edit Policy -> Visual Editor
- Find the Deny Action for `Cloud Shell` and click `Remove` on the right
- Review policy
- Save changes

---

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/108776959-1882ba80-7531-11eb-8b8e-3247db81c3de.gif" width=50% height=50%>


> &#8505; Qwiklabs has an explicit Deny for CloudShell. However, we have permissions to remove this deny policy. Take a look at the other Deny statements while you are here.

> &#8505; It is important to be familiar with IAM concepts for VM-Series deployments. Several features (such as bootstrap, custom metrics, cloudwatch logs, HA, VM Monitoring) require IAM permissions. You also need to consider IAM perimssions in order to deploy with IaC or if using lambda for custom automation.

---

## 3.3. Launch CloudShell

- Search for `cloudshell` in top search bar
- Close out of the Intro Screen
- Allow a few moments for it to initialize

---

> &#8505; This lab will use cloudshell for access to AWS CLI and as a runtime environment to provision your lab resources in AWS using terraform. Cloudshell will have the same IAM role as your authenticated user and has some utilities (git, aws cli, etc) pre-installed. It is only available in limited regions currently.
>
> Anything saved in home directory `/home/cloudshell-user` will remain persistent if you close and relaunch CloudShell

---

## 3.4. Search Available VM-Series Images (AMIs)

- In cloud console, enter:

```
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=owner-alias,Values=aws-marketplace" --filters Name=name,Values=PA-VM-AWS-10* Name=product-code,Values=6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah --region us-west-2
```

> &#10067; How many different BYOL AMIs are avilable for 10.x in this region?

- We see that `10.0.4` AMI is availble, which is what we are targeting for this deployment

> &#10067; What is the Marketplace AMI ID for 10.0.4 in this region?

> &#10067; What are some options if there is no AMI available for your targetd version?

- Try using query to control what data is returned

```
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=owner-alias,Values=aws-marketplace" --filters Name=name,Values=PA-VM-AWS-10* Name=product-code,Values=6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah --region us-west-2 --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Name]'
```

---

> &#8505;  This terraform deployment will look up the AMI ID to use for the deployment based on the variable `fw_version`. New AMIs are not always published for each minor release. Therefore, it is a good idea to verify what version AMI most closely matches your target version.

> &#8505; product-code is a global value that correlates with Palo Alto Networks marketplace offerings This is global and the same across all regions. There will be changes to this as vm-flex offerings come live.
>```
>   "byol"  = "6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah"
>   "payg1" = "6kxdw3bbmdeda3o6i1ggqt4km"
>   "payg2" = "806j2of0qy5osgjjixq9gqc6g"
>```

> &#8505; The name tag of the image should be standard and can be used for the filter. For example `PA-VM-AWS-9.1*`, `PA-VM-AWS-9.1.3*`, `PA-VM-AWS-10*`. This is the same logic the terraform will use to lookup the AMI based on the `fw_version` variable.

> &#8505; Not needed for this lab, but when deploying VM-Series from EC2 console, it will default to the latest version. You can instead go to the AWS Marketplace to subscribe to the offering and select previous versions to deploy the desired AMI
>

---


## 3.5. Download Terraform 

- Download Terraform in Cloudshell

```
mkdir /home/cloudshell-user/bin/ && wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.13.6/terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip && unzip terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip && rm terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip && mv terraform /home/cloudshell-user/bin/terraform
```

- Verify Terraform 0.13.6 is installed
```
terraform --version
```

> &#8505; Terraform projects often have version constraints in the code to protect against potentially breaking syntax changes when new version is released. For this project, the [version constraint](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ps-regional-2021-aws-labs/blob/main/terraform/vmseries/versions.tf) is:
> ```
> terraform {
>  required_version = ">=0.12.29, <0.14"
>}
>```
>
>Terraform is distributed as a single binary so isn't usually managed by OS package managers. It simply needs to be downloaded and put into a system `$PATH` location. For Cloudshell, we are using the `/home/cloud-shell-user/bin/` so it will be persistent if the sessions times out.


## 3.6. Clone Deployment Git Repository 

- Clone the Repository with the terraform to deploy
  
```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ps-regional-2021-aws-labs.git && cd ps-regional-2021-aws-labs/terraform/vmseries
```

## 3.7. Update Deployment Values in tfvars




For simplicity, only the variable values that need to be modified are separated into a separate tfvars file.


- Use vi to update values in `student.auto.tfvars`

```
vi student.auto.tfvars
```

- Update the specifics of your deployment
- Anything marked with `##` should be replaced with your Student Number
- Anything marked with `xxx` should be replaced with the appropriate values for this deployment
- Reference `lab-details.txt` downloaded from QwikLabs console for values
- Don't forget to update `ssh_key_name` with they name of they key you copied previously from EC2 console!

> &#8505; (Optional) If you don't like vi, you can install nano editor:
> ```
> sudo yum install -y nano
> ```


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/108796675-47138c00-7557-11eb-99b4-58141a3cf874.gif" width=50% height=50%>


```
ssh_key_name     = "qwikLABS-xxx"

### VMSERIES ###
firewalls = [

    fw_tags = {}
    bootstrap_options = {
      mgmt-interface-swap = "enable"

      { name = "vmseries01-mgmt", index = "1" },
    ]
  },
  {

    fw_tags = {}
    bootstrap_options = {
      mgmt-interface-swap = "enable"

      type                = "dhcp-client"
      hostname            = "lab##_vmseries02"
      tplname             = "TPL-STUDENT-STACK-##"
      dgname              = "DG-STUDENT-##"

      op-command-modes    = ""
    }
    interfaces = [
      { name = "vmseries02-data", index = "0" },
      { name = "vmseries02-mgmt", index = "1" },
    ]
  }
]
```

> &#8505; This deployment is using a [newer feature for basic bootstrapping](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/plugins/vm-series-and-panorama-plugins-release-notes/vm-series-plugin/vm-series-plugin-20/vm-series-plugin-201/whats-new-in-vm-series-plugin-201.html) that does not require S3 buckets. Any paramaters normally specified in init-cfg can now be passed directly to the instance via UserData. Prerequisite is the image you are deploying has plugin 2.0.1+ installed

> &#8505; Notice the plugin-op-command to enable the GWLB inspection. There are additional bootstrap parameters planned for 10.0.5 to set GWLB sub-interface associations to endpoints.

> &#10067; What are some bootstrap options that won't be possible with this basic bootstrap method?

> &#8505; If you have time left after the rest of the lab activities, later steps will return to do some more digging into the terraform code.

## 3.8. Apply Terraform

- Make sure you are in the appropriate directory

```
cd /home/cloudshell-user/ps-regional-2021-aws-labs/terraform/vmseries
```
- Initialize Terraform

```
terraform init
```

- Apply Terraform

```
terraform apply
```

- When Prompted for confirmation, type `yes`


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/108799781-36671400-755f-11eb-9724-d18c7ea147bb.gif" width=50% height=50%>


- It should take 5-10 minutes for terraform to finish deploying all resources

- When complete, you will see a list of outputs. Copy these locally so you can reference them in later steps

- If you do get an error, first try to run `terraform apply` again to finish update of any pending resources

> &#8505; You can also come back to this directory in CloudShell later and run `terraform output` to view this information 



## 3.9. Inspect deployed resources

All resources are now created in AWS, but it will be around 10 minutes until VM-Series are fully initialized and bootstrapped.

In the meantime, lets go look at what you built!


- EC2 Dashboard -> Instances -> Select `vmseries01` -> Actions -> Instance settings -> Edit user data

- Verify the values matches what was provided in your Lab Details

> &#10067; What are some tradeoffs of using user-data method for bootstrap vs S3 bucket?

> &#10067; What needs to happen if you have a typo or missed a value for bootstrap when you deployed?

---
### 3.9.1. Get VM-Series instance screenshot

- EC2 Dashboard -> Instances -> Select `vmseries01` -> Actions -> Monitor and troubleshoot -> Get instance screenshot

> &#8505; This can be useful to get a view of the console during launch. It is not interactive and must be manually refershed, but you can at least see some output related to bootstrap process or to troubleshoot if the VM-Series isn't booting properly or is in maintenance mode.

---

### 3.9.2. Check VM-Series instance details

- EC2 Dashboard -> Instances -> Select `vmseries01` -> Review info / tabs in bottom pane


> &#10067; What is the instance type? Which BYOL model(s) would this instance type be appropriate for?

> &#10067; How many interfaces are associated to the VM-Series? Which interface is the default ENI for the instance? Which interfaces have public IPs associated?

> &#10067; Check the security group associated with the "data" interface. What is allowed inbound? What is the logic of this SG?

> &#10067; What Instance Profile was the VM-Series launched with? What actions does it allow? What are some other use-cases where you need to allow additional IAM permissions for the instance profile?

---

### 3.9.3. Check cloudwatch bootstrap logs

- Search for `cloudwatch` in the top search bar
- Logs -> Log groups -> PaloAltoNetworksFirewalls
- Assuming enough time has passed since launch, verify that the bootstrap operations completed successfully.

> &#8505; It is normal for the VMs to briefly lose connectivity to Panorama after first joining.

> &#8505; This feature is only implemented for AWS currently.

> &#10067; What is required to enable these logs during boot process?

---


## 3.10. Verify Bootstrap in Panorama

> &#8505; We are using a shared Panorama for this lab that is publically accessible. For production deployments, Panorama management should not be exposed to inbound Internet traffic. Each student has their own credentials restricted to Access Domain for only the relevant Device Group & Templates to reduce clutter.

- Refer to `lab-details.txt` from QwikLabs for connection and credential details for Panorama
- Login to Panorama web interface with student credentials
- Check Panorama -> Managed Deivces -> Summary
- Verify your deployed VM-Series are connected and successfully bootstrapped
- Verify that the auto-commit push succeeded for Shared Policy and Template and that devices are "In sync"
- Inspect Pre-Configured Interface, Zone, and Virtual Router configuration for your template
- Inspect Pre-Configured Security Policies and NAT Policies for your Device Group

> &#10067; Why are NAT policies not needed for GWLB model?


## 3.11. Access VM-Series Management

- Most configurations will be done in Panorama, but we will use the local consoles for some steps and validation
- Refer to `lab-details.txt` from QwikLabs for local credential details
- Refer to the output you copied from your terraform deployment for the public EIPs associated to each VM-Series management interface
  
```
vmseries_eips = {
  "vmseries01-mgmt" = "54.71.121.124"
  "vmseries02-mgmt" = "44.237.145.237"
}
```
- Establish a connection to both VM-Series Web UI via HTTPS
- Establish a connection to both VM-Series CLI via SSH

> &#10067; Why don't you have to use SSH key pair to authenticate to these VM-Series?

## 3.12. Check bootstrap logs

> &#8505; It is common to have issues when initially setting up an environment for bootstrapping. Thus it is a good to know how to troubleshoot. When using the new basic bootsrapping with user-data, there is less potential for problems.
>
> Some things to keep in mind:
>- Default AWS ENI needs access to reach S3 bucket as well as path to Internet for licnesing
>   - S3 access can be via Internet or with VPC endpoint
>   - IAM Instance Profile will need permissions to access S3 bucket
> - When using interface swap, the subnet for the second ENI will also need path to S3 and Internet
>   - Interface swap can be done with user-data or in init-cfg parameters. 
>   - Generally better to do via user-data
> - Template Stack and Device Group names must match exactly or they will never join Panorama (no inidcation of this in Panorama logs)
> - If there are any issues with licesning, VM-Series will not join Panorama (no indication of this in Panorama logs)

- From SSH session on either VM-Series, check the bootstrap summary
  
```show system bootstrap status```

- Check the bootstrap detail log

```debug logview component bts_details```

> &#8505; If you have Cloudwatch logs enabled, you can see most of this status without SSH session to VM-Series.


## 3.13. Fix GWLB Health Probes

- Check GWLB Target Group status
  - In EC2 Console -> Target Groups -> select `ps-lab-security-gwlb`
  - Verify health check settings of TCP 80 first `Group details` tab
  - Switch to `Targets` tab and note that the status of both VM-Series is unhealthy

> &#10067; What Protocol and Port is the Target Group configured to use

> &#8505; You can check traffic logs either in Panorama or local device

> &#8505; **Reboot your VM-Series if you do not see any traffic logs!**
> 
- Check Traffic Logs for Health Probes
  - In Panorama UI -> Monitor -> Traffic
  - Analyze the traffic logs for the port 80 traffic
  - Enable Columns to view `Bytes Sent` and `Bytes Received`
  - Notice that the sessions matching allow policy for `gwlb-permit-any` policy but aging out

> &#10067; Why are there two different source addresses in the traffic logs for these GWLB Health Probes?

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/109860663-6af86100-7c2c-11eb-88f3-0aac14d256a8.gif" width=50% height=50%>

- Resolve the issue with the Health Probes

- **To verify your solution (or shortcut!), expand below for specific steps**

<details>
  <summary>Expand Me For Specific Steps</summary>

> &#8505; We can see in the traffic logs that the health probes are being received. So we know they are being permitted by the AWS Security Group. They are being permitted by catch-all security policy but there is no return traffic (Notice 0 Bytes Received in the traffic logs). This indicates the VM-Series dataplane interface is not listening 

  - Create and add Interface Management profile to eth1/1
    - In Panorama select Network Tab -> Template `TPL-STUDENT-BASE-##`
    - Create Interface Management Profile
      - Name: `gwlb-health-probe`
      - Services: HTTP
      - Permitted IP addresses: `10.100.0.16/28`, `10.100.1.16/28`
    - Select Interfaces -> ethernet1/1 -> Advanced -> Management Profile `gwlb-health-probe`

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/109861732-9fb8e800-7c2d-11eb-87b7-98e794ce8131.gif" width=50% height=50%>

  - Create a specific security policies for these health probes to keep logging clean
    - In Panorama select Policies Tab -> Device Group `DG-STUDENT-##`
    - Create new security policy
      - Name: `gwlb-health-probe`
      - Source Zone: `gwlb`
      - Source Addresses: `10.100.0.16/28`, `10.100.1.16/28`
      - Dest Zone: `gwlb`
      - Dest Addresses: `10.100.0.16/28`, `10.100.1.16/28`
      - Application: `Any`
      - Serivce: `service-http`
    - Make sure new policy is before the existing catch-all `gwlb-any` policy

  - Commit and Push your changes

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/109866175-f674f080-7c32-11eb-8c77-4e2c3c195f9a.gif" width=50% height=50%>


</details>

- Verify Traffic Logs have Bytes Received and are mataching the appropriate security policy
- Return to AWS console to verify the Targets are now showing as healthy

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/109867219-3b4d5700-7c34-11eb-8121-5ce90f2e1004.gif" width=50% height=50%>


> &#10067; Why is the application still detected as incomplete?

## 3.14. Inbound Traffic Flows to Spoke App VPCs

- The deployed topology does not have all of the AWS routing in place for a working GWLB topology and you must fix it!
- Refer to the diagram and try to resolve before looking at the specific steps.

###  3.14.1. Update Spokes VPC networking for Inbound inspection with GWLB

> &#8505; For GWLB model, Inbound traffic for public services comes directly into the spoke Internet Gateway. Ingress VPC route table directs traffic to the GWLB Endpoint in the spoke VPC.
> 
> Application owners can provision their external facing resources in their VPC (EIP, Public NLB / ALB, etc), but all traffic will be forwarded to Security VPC (via GWLB endpoint) for inspection prior to reaching the resource.
> 
> This inbound traffic flow does not involve the Transit Gateway at all.

- First investigate `ps-lab-app1_spoke_vpc` Route Tables in the VPC Dashboard and try to identify and fix what is missing. Refer to the diagram for guidance.
- For inbound traffic, no changes are needed for the `web` route tables
- Tip: In the VPC Dashboard you can set a filter by VPC, which will apply to any other sections of the dashboard (subnets, route tables, etc)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43679669/110424278-8b7f4b80-8070-11eb-91e2-87bab5882f21.gif" width=50% height=50%> 


- **To verify your solution (or shortcut!), expand below for specific steps**

<details>
  <summary>Expand For Specific Steps</summary>

  - VPC Dashboard -> Tranist Gateway Route Tables -> Select `ps-lab-from-spoke-vpcs`
  -  Check `Associations` tab and verify the two spoke App VPCs are associated
  -  Check Routes tab and notice there are no existing routes
  -  Create Static Route (Default to security VPC)
     - CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
     - Attachment: Security VPC (Name Tag = ps-lab-security-vpc)

###  3.14.2. Verify HTTP traffic to Spoke web servers

//TODO - Add Steps


###  3.14.3. Access Spoke web servers via SSH

- ssh from local machine to the NLB associated with app1 and app2 apps
  - hostname will be the FQDN of the NLBs from the terraform output
  - username is `ec2-user`
  - ssh key was downloaded from Qwiklabs console

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/qwikLABS-L17939-10296.pem ec2-user@ps-lab-app1-nlb-d42f371991908c49.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

> &#8505; We now have secured inbound connectivity but instances do not yet have a path outbound / inbound

//TODO - Add Steps

### 3.14.4. Check Logs for Inbound traffic and Create Security Policies

//TODO - Add Steps


## 3.15. Outbound and East / West (OBEW) Traffic Flows

- The deployed topology does not have all of the AWS routing in place for a working GWLB topology and you must fix it!
- Refer to the diagram and try to resolve before looking at the specific steps.


### 3.15.1. Update Transit Gateway (TGW) Route Tables


> &#8505; For GWLB model, the TGW routing for Outbound and EastWest (OB/EW) traffic is the same as previous TGW models. Spoke TGW RT directs all traffic to Security VPC. Security TGW RT has routes to reach all spoke VPCs for return traffic.
>
>For OB/EW flows, the GWLB doesn't come into play until traffic comes into the Security VPC from TGW

- First investigate Transit Gateway Route Tables in the VPC Dashboard and try to identify and fix what is missing. Refer to the diagram for guidance.

- **To verify your solution (or shortcut!), expand below for specific steps**

<details>
  <summary>Expand For Specific Steps</summary>

  - VPC Dashboard -> Tranist Gateway Route Tables -> Select `ps-lab-from-spoke-vpcs`
  -  Check `Associations` tab and verify the two spoke App VPCs are associated
  -  Check Routes tab and notice there are no existing routes
  -  Create Static Route (Default to security VPC)
     - CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
     - Attachment: Security VPC (Name Tag = ps-lab-security-vpc)

- VPC Dashboard -> Tranist Gateway Route Tables -> Select `ps-lab-from-security-vpc`
  -  Check `Associations` tab and verify the security VPC is associated
  -  Check `Routes` tab and notice there are no existing routes
  -  Select Propagations Tab -> Create Propagation
  -  Select attachement with Name Tag `ps-lab-app1-vpc`
  -  Repeat for attachement with Name Tag `ps-lab-app2-vpc`
  -  Return to `Routes` tab and verify the table now has routes to reach the App VPCs

> &#10067; What needs to be done on the TGW route tables in order to bring additional Spoke VPCs online for OB/EW traffic?


### 3.15.2. Update Security VPC networking for OB/EW with GWLB

> &#8505; The routing and traffic flows can be tricky to grasp, especially when designing for multiple availability zones. For this lab, we are using separate endpoint for Outbound VS EastWest, plus separate endpoint per AZ. Take your time and understand the traffic flows as you configure the routing.
>
> For multi-AZ GWLB, generally will require unique route tables per subnet in both AZs in order to direct traffic in that AZ toward the resources (GWLB endpoint, NAT GW) in the same AZ.

- First investigate the VPC Route Tables in the Security VPC and try to identify and fix what is missing. Refer to the diagram for guidance.
- Refer to your output from terraform for the GWLB Endpoint IDs
- You can also view the deployed endpoints VPC Dashboard -> Endpoints

- **To verify your solution (or shortcut!), expand below for specific steps**

<details>
  <summary>Expand For Specific Steps</summary>

  - VPC Dashboard -> Filter by VPC in left menu -> Select `ps-lab-security`
    - Now when checking other sections in this dashboard (route tables, subnets, etc) will be filtered to Security VPC
  -  Select Route Tables section
  -  Look through the route tables. Most have no routes!
  -  Identify Security VPC in the Topology Diagram ane we will start from left-to-right

**TGW Attach Route Tables**

> &#8505; Here we are defining what will happen for any traffic coming in to the Security VPC from the TGW. 
> If traffic is destined for private summary range, we will send it to the EastWest GWLB Endpoints
>
> If traffic is desitned for anything else (default route), we will send it to the Outbound GWLB Endpoint
>
> For AZ resielence, we also make sure that whatever AZ traffic comes in from TGW it is forwarded to the GWLB endpoint in the same AZ
>
> Any traffic send to these endpoints will go directly to GWLB / VM-Series as a "bump-in-the-wire" and return to the corresponding endpoint

  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-tgw-attach1` and edit routes
     -  0.0.0.0/0 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint `outbound1`
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `outbound1` from terraform output
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint 
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `eastwest1` from terraform output
  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-tgw-attach2` and edit routes
     -  0.0.0.0/0 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint `outbound2`
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `outbound2` from terraform output
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint 
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `eastwest2` from terraform output

**GWLB Endpoint East/West Route Tables**

> &#8505; Here we are defining what will happen for East / West traffic returning from the GWLB / VM-Series.
> This means traffic has already passed policy / inspection and we now define the direct path to reach the destination.
>
> For East / West traffic, this means sending all internal traffic to the TGW where it will then be forwarded directly back to the spoke VPC. 
> 
> Note that Backhaul traffic (VPN / DirectConnect attachments to TGW) would also follow this same logic.

  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-gwlbe-eastwest-1` and edit routes
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Transit Gateway -> Select TGW ID
  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-gwlbe-eastwest-2` and edit routes
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Transit Gateway -> Select TGW ID

> For this traffic, routes are identical for both AZs, so doesn't strictly require separate route tables. We maintain the separation only for consistency and clarity.

<img src="" width=50% height=50%>

**GWLB Endpoint Outbound Route Tables**

> &#8505; Here we are defining what will happen for Outbund traffic returning from the GWLB / VM-Series.
> This means traffic has already passed policy / inspection and we now define the direct path to reach the destination.
>
> For Outbound traffic, this means sending all traffic toward the NAT GW in the corresponding AZ. 
> 
> We also need to consider the return traffic from the Internet / NAT GW which uses the same GWLB Endpoint. For this we define a path to reach the Spoke VPC summary directly via TGW 

//TODO - Add NAT GW IDs to Terraform output

  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-gwlbe-outbound-1` and edit routes
     -  0.0.0.0/0 -> NAT Gateway -> Select NAT GW ID for AZ1
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Transit Gateway -> Select TGW ID
  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-gwlbe-outbound-2` and edit routes
     -  0.0.0.0/0 -> NAT Gateway -> Select NAT GW ID for AZ2
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Transit Gateway -> Select TGW ID

<img src="" width=50% height=50%>

**NAT Gateway Route Tables**

> &#8505; Here we are defining what will happen for return traffic from the Internet for traffic that was initiated outbound.
> From the perspective of the NAT GW routing, we direct the Spoke VPC summary back to Outbound Endpoint of the respective AZ so the return traffic will be forwarded to GWLB / VM-Series.
> 
> Note: The NAT GW subnet is already provisioned with default route pointed to IGW

  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-natgw1` and edit routes
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint `outbound1`
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `outbound1` from terraform output
  -  Select Route Table `ps-lab-natgw2` and edit routes
     -  10.0.0.0/8 -> Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint `outbound2`
     -  Select vpce Endpoint ID `outbound2` from terraform output
