## Overview

This lab will involve deploying a solution for AWS using Palo Alto Networks VM-Series in the Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) topology.

## Deployment

- Login to console
- Verify in correct region 

### Step x: Update IAM Policies


- Search for `IAM` in top searchbar (IAM is global)
- In IAM dashboard select Users -> awsstudent
- Expand `default_policy`, Edit Policy -> Visual Editor
- Find the Deny Action for `Cloud Shell` and click `Remove` on the right
- Review policy / save changes

```
"cloudshell:*"
```

Note: If using the json editor, you will syntax error if you leave trailing comma on line 32 after removing `cloudshell`

### Step x: Launch CloudShell

- Search for `cloudshell` in top search bar

This lab will use cloudshell for access to AWS CLI and as a runtime environment to provision your lab resources in AWS using terraform. Cloudshell will have the same IAM role as your authenticated user and has some utilities (git, aws cli, etc) pre-installed. It is only available in limited regions currently.


- Check which Marketplace VM-Series images (AMIs) are available

This terraform deployment will look up the AMI ID to use for the deployment based on the variable `fw_version`. New AMIs are not always published for each minor release. Therefore, it is a good idea to verify what version AMI most closely matches your target version.

In cloud console, enter:

`aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=owner-alias,Values=aws-marketplace" --filters Name=name,Values=PA-VM-AWS-10* Name=product-code,Values=6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah --region us-west-2`

How many different BYOL AMIs are avilable for 10.x in this region?

product-code is a global value that correlates with Palo Alto Networks marketplace offerings. This is global and the same across all regions. There will be changes to this as vm-flex offerings come live.

```
    "byol"  = "6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah"
    "payg1" = "6kxdw3bbmdeda3o6i1ggqt4km"
    "payg2" = "806j2of0qy5osgjjixq9gqc6g"
```
The name tag of the image should be standard and can be used for the filter. For example `PA-VM-AWS-9.1*`, `PA-VM-AWS-9.1.3*`, `PA-VM-AWS-10*`. This is the same logic the terraform will use to lookup the AMI based on the `fw_version` variable.

**We see that 10.0.4 AMI is availble, so we will use that for the variable**


- Generate SSH Key in cloudshell

Any EC2 Instance must be associated with a SSH keypair, which is the default method of initial interactive login to instances. With successful bootstrapping, there should not be any need to connect to the VM-Series instances direclty with this key, but it is usually good to keep this key securely stored for any emergency backdoor access. For this lab, a keypair will be generated in the cloudshell and then terraform will create a corresponding object in AWS using the same key.

`ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ps-lab -t rsa -C ps-lab`


### Step x: Clone the Repository

- Download Terraform in Cloudshell

TODO: Replace with one-liner

```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.13.6/terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip
rm terraform_0.13.6_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/bin/
```

Verify 
`terraform --version`



```
$ git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ps-regional-2021-aws-labs.git
```

### Step x: Update tfvars

- //TODO add notes about terraform general usage, handling sensitive values, etc

For simplicity, only the variable values that need to be modified are separated into a separate tfvars file.

- Change into terraform directory
- Use nano or vi to modify `student.auto.tfvars`
- Update the specifics of your deployment
- Anything marked with `###` should be replaced with appropriate value

We will be using the newer feature for light bootstrapping that does not require S3 buckets. Essentially, all of the paramaters normally specific in init-cfg can now be passed directly to the instance via user-data.

```
firewalls = [
  {
    name    = "vmseries01"
    fw_tags = {}
    bootstrap_options = {
      mgmt-interface-swap = "enable"
      plugin-op-commands  = "aws-gwlb-inspect:enable"
      type                = "dhcp-client"
      hostname            = "lab###_vmseries01"
      panorama-server     = "###"
      panorama-server-2   = "###"
      tplname             = "TPL-STUDENT-STACK-###"
      dgname              = "DG-STUDENT-###"
      vm-auth-key         = "###"
      authcodes           = "###"
      #op-command-modes    = ""
    }
    interfaces = [
      { name = "vmseries01-data", index = "0" },
      { name = "vmseries01-mgmt", index = "1" },
    ]
  },
  {
    name    = "vmseries02"
    fw_tags = {}
    bootstrap_options = {
      mgmt-interface-swap = "enable"
      plugin-op-commands  = "aws-gwlb-inspect:enable"
      type                = "dhcp-client"
      hostname            = "lab#_vmseries02"
      panorama-server     = "###"
      panorama-server-2   = "###"
      tplname             = "###"
      dgname              = "###"
      vm-auth-key         = "###"
      authcodes           = "###"
      #op-command-modes    = ""
    }
    interfaces = [
      { name = "vmseries02-data", index = "0" },
      { name = "vmseries02-mgmt", index = "1" },
    ]
  }
]
```

### Step x: Apply Terraform

- Terraform init / apply




### Step x: Things to do while waiting on launch

- Look at user data
- Check instance screenshot
- Check cloudwatch bootstrap logs
- Look at VPC & TGW route tables, endpoints, correlate to the topology diagram
- 


### Step 50: Finished

Congratulations!

You have now successfully â€¦.
